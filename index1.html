		<h1><u>Save Dogs</u></h1>
		<br><br>
		<p>Millions of stray dogs live on the streets of India. Most are direct descendants of their feral canine ancestors, a "breed" much older than any AKC (American Kennel Club) breed. With the recent increase in popularity among Indians of full breed dogs, more and more street dogs are abandoned pets or have bred with pet breeds.
	<br>
	<br><br>
	Although they are widely feared because some carry rabies, for the most part India's street dogs are not aggressive and will only bite if provoked. Indeed, many are fearful of humans and sadly, the dogs' fears are well founded.
	<br><br><br>
	India's street dog population is closely associated with municipal sanitation practices – or neglect thereof. Because these homeless dogs often survive by scavenging rubbish, exposed garbage means more healthy dogs – and more puppies. Ironically, this actually makes the dogs a boon to public sanitation. By scavenging garbage, they reduce perishable waste that could otherwise be a source of contamination for people. And their presence around garbage keeps away other potentially dangerous scavengers, such as rats and mice.
	<br><br><br>

	Unfortunately, fear and ignorance have led many Indian citizens and officials to see street dogs as nothing but a nuisance and to seek eradication using inhumane methods such as poisoning and beating. But for every dog killed, another typically comes in to take over that dog's territory. The only scientific method to humanely reduce street dog populations is mass spay and neuters, commonly known as animal birth control (ABC).
	<br><br><br>

	Through ABC programs, all the dogs within a community or region are sterilized and then released back to their territories. The result: dog breeding stops and their population declines.
	<br><br><br>

	Help Animals India funds ABC programs across India and have funded the sterilization of hundreds of thousands of street dogs from partner organizations including, Varanasi for Animals, Karuna Society for Animals and Nature, HOPE and Animal Trust, Just Be Friendly, Sarnath Animal Welfare, Raahat, CUPA, and more.

		<h1>How to save dogs</h1>
		<p>If you love dogs, then you probably want to save them. Although this might 
		seem like an overwhelming task, there are many ways you can help dogs. If you're
		 looking for a pet, adopt a rescue dog or foster dogs who are looking for their 
		forever home. Additionally, support your local shelters or rescues by volunteering 
	     or donating needed items. Finally, you can help dogs by speaking up for them.
	     </p>
	
	<div class="home2" >
		<h1>Method 1</h1> <h2>Helping Dogs in Your Area</h2>
		<img src="image/1.jpg">
		<p class="home2">
		
            Adopt a dog from a local shelter or rescue instead of buying a puppy. 
            Follow the mantra, “Adopt, don’t shop.” Visit the shelter to see the dogs
             that are available for adoption, or look at the shelter's website. 
             When you're ready to adopt a dog, ask a shelter employee or volunteer
              for an application. Fill out and submit the application, then complete
               the adoption requirements for that shelter or rescue, which can vary.
            Some shelters and rescues will allow you to take a dog home the same day 
            you fill out an application, but others may require a waiting period or 
            potentially a home visit. Talk to an employee or volunteer to learn more.
            You can find lots of different breeds at shelters and rescues, so don’t assume
             you won’t find the type of dog you want.
            If you have another pet or other family members, it’s best for all of you to 
            spend time with the dog before you sign the papers to adopt it.
            You can look for a local shelter or rescue online.</p>

	<div class="home3 ">
		<h1>Method 1</h1> <h2>Foster dogs to prevent overcrowding at your local shelter or rescue.</h2>
		<img src="image/2.jpg">
		<p id="home3 ">
			Fostering a dog means caring for it in your home until a forever home is found. To start fostering, contact your local shelter or rescue to submit an application or your contact information. Then, visit the shelter to decide which dogs you'd be willing to foster. If you're approved, take your foster dogs home.[2]
            <li>If you foster, you may want to attend local adoption events to help your foster pups find a forever home. Additionally, the shelter may ask you to allow potential adopters to come meet your foster dog.</li>
            <li>Fostering allows the shelter to clear out space for other pets while still keeping a dog available for adoption. This means the shelter or rescue can save more dogs.</li>
		</p>
		
	</div>
	<div class="home4 ">
		<h1>Method 1</h1><h2>Care for dogs you find on the street until you find their owner. </h2>
		<img src="image/3.jpg">
		<p  id="home4 ">When you see a stray dog running around on the streets, try to get it to a safe location, whether that’s your car, your home, or a nearby yard. Then, tend to the dog’s needs while you post fliers and online posts looking for the owner. Additionally, take it to the vet or a local shelter so they can check to see if it has a microchip that will help locate the owner.

       <li>If the dog appears shy or aggressive, don’t try to touch it. Instead, call animal control to come catch it. If you can, lure it into a safe location, like a fenced in yard, until animal control can arrive.</li>
        <li>Don’t risk a car accident or endanger others while you’re trying to save the dog.</li></p>
		
	</div>
	<div class= "home5 ">
		<h1>Method 1</h1> <h2>Avoid breeding your dog, which contributes to overpopulation</h2>
		<img src="image/4.jpg">
		<p id="home5 ">Although puppies are cute, raising them isn’t worth adding to the growing pet population. Every puppy you sell or give away will go to a home that may have adopted a shelter pet. Rather than risking a litter of puppies, get your pet spayed or neutered so it can’t reproduce.[4]
       <li>If you really want to raise puppies, contact a local shelter or rescue to let them know you're interested in   fostering a litter of abandoned puppies. They will take your information so they can contact you when they need a caregiver for some puppies.</li>
        <li>As an added benefit, dogs that are spayed or neutered are typically healthier.</li></p>
